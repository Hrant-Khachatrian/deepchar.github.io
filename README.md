Transliteration with sequence-to-sequence models and transfer learning

[github.com/deepchar](https://github.com/deepchar)

### What is transliteration?

### Our approach

Our baseline approach is to train **character-level sequence-to-sequence** models.  Besides the modification to character-level, they are very standard modern reference implementations of sequence-to-sequence developed by Facebook AI Research on PyTorch, primarily for machine *translation* but in principle applicable to a wide range of tasks with sequence input and sequence output.

### Transfer learning

### Datasets

Constrained by lack of parallel corpora, and inspired by similar approaches to transliteration and other sequence-to-sequence tasks like grammar correction, we rely primarily on **data generation**.
